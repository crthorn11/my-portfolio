  I am a highly motivated individual who speaks Spanish, loves to learn and instruct others teaching them from my mistakes and how to do things properly. There is nothing that has fulfilled me more than having taught younger technicians how to better themselves and seeing their faces as they advance their careers and see themselves growing into a true diagnostic technician. As I mentioned before I am highly motivated, I started with Honda as an express tech 4 years ago having worked my way up into becoming a Honda Master technician and fulfilling various extra responsibilities as needed throughout the dealership including filling in for the shop foreman in times of absence, handling dispatching and continued training inexperienced technicians on their journey to become a diagnostic tech.

  Now I have dove into the software engineering world of careers and have first hand experience to offer in dealer relations, sales, automotive upsales and much more. Having someone to help create your companys premiere website with both first hand and software engineering experience is important for efficiency and client satisfaction. Here we have an Horiseon challenge.
